# ReflectionUtilsClass
A class which implements Java Reflection API

Copy ReflectionUtils into your project.
Call it and use it as demonstrated in the SpringBootApplication.java class.

It can be used to set/get private parameters and to invoke private methods on other classes.

In the example shown, we set/get private parameters and invoke private method of class ReflectionUtilsTestClass.java from the external class SpringBootApplication.java

Note: import only ReflectionUtils.java, not the other classes present in the repository.
Use it as demonstrated in the other two classes.
